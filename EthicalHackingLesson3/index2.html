<h2>Ethical Hacking Lesson 3: Ethics of Vulnerability Disclosure</h2>
<h4> In this challenge, you have to read the scenario and decide if the vulnerability in the system has been disclosed ethically or not by choosing your own method of disclosure. </h4> 
<div id="main">	
	<div id="content">
		<img src="smartfridge.png" id="news" alt="Smart Fridge">
		<p id="text"> Thereâ€™s a brand new smart fridge, brought to you by a trusted well known company, that comes equipped with a camera that monitors fridge activity. The fridge is designed to allow people associated with the account to view the footage but not others. A researcher is investigating the smart fridge and discovers a vulnerability that allows anybody to watch the camera feed unverified.  </p>
