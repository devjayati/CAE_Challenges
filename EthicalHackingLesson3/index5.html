<h2>Ethical Hacking Lesson 3: Ethics of Vulnerability Disclosure</h2>
<h4> In this challenge, you have to read the scenario and decide if the vulnerability in the system has been disclosed ethically or not by choosing your own method of disclosure.  </h4> 
<div id="main">	
	<div id="content">
		<img src="trucks.png" id="news" alt="Driveless Trucks">
		<p id="text"> Driverless trucks have revolutionized long haul trucking. These giant machines travel roads without someone needing to be behind the wheel by utilizing GPS. A researcher was investigating the security of the GPS updating system and discovered that it is relatively easy for someone to insert their own maps into this update, this could potentially cause a truck to turn left when it needs to go straight. This could cause mass accidents. </p>
