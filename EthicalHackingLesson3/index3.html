<h2>Ethical Hacking Lesson 3: Ethics of Vulnerability Disclosure</h2>
<h4> In this challenge, you have to read the scenario and decide if the vulnerability in the system has been disclosed ethically or not by choosing your own method of disclosure.  </h4>

		<p  id="text"> Your cousin got a new toy for his birthday. He quickly becomes bored with it and the next time you’re at his house you decide to play with it and see what you can do with it. It’s internet connected and has audio recording and messaging capabilities. You realize that it is possible to send messages to the toy without being connected through the official parent app. You send emails to the manufacturer and they don’t respond. The manufacturer is a small overseas company and so you don’t know how else to contact them.
