<h2>Ethical Hacking Lesson 3: Ethics of Vulnerability Disclosure</h2>
<h4> In this challenge, you have to read the scenario and decide if the vulnerability in the system has been disclosed ethically or not by choosing your own method of disclosure.  </h4>

		<p id="text"> Brenda’s Grandpa just got a new smart dialysis home device. This allows him to do his treatments at home on his own. The device knows how long it needs to work by monitoring the toxins in his blood as it filters it. Brenda is a high school student but the most tech savvy in her family, so Brenda is asked to help her grandpa set it up. Brenda is looking at the application on grandpa’s phone which sends alerts to remind him to do his treatment, gives real time reports on blood levels, and can even send reports to his doctor with a click of a button, the application describes that the doctor can send updates to the treatment goals and the device will learn from these instructions. Brenda realizes that if the wrong email is put into the app for the doctor that whoever it sends to could adjust grandpa’s treatment. Just as likely, if the doctor sends an adjustment with the wrong decimal point placement then it could be lethal for grandpa. </p>
